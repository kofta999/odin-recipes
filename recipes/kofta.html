    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      There are thousands of different versions of this Middle Eastern-style
      meatball on a skewer; with different garnishes, and different spellings,
      but whether you enjoy yours with tahini, or yogurt sauce, or call it
      kofta, or kofte, or kefta, or kufta, or qofte, this is one my all-time
      favorite things to grill. I'll take a plain old meatball anyway, but a
      grilled meatball is a very special thing indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Authentic versions are actually done using long, flat metal skewers, which
      are great at holding on to the meat, and make it possible to quickly turn
      these on the grill, but soaked bamboo skewers work just fine. Since we're
      going to use tongs to turn ours, the skewers are mostly ornamental here,
      but if we're going to call it a kebab, we need to pierce our meat with
      something. Otherwise, as I joked about in the video, we're just making
      grilled meat logs. And no one wants to be served something called,
      "grilled meat logs."

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 slice whole grain bread, toasted</li>
      <li>½ medium yellow onion, diced</li>
      <li>⅓ cup chopped Italian parsley</li>

      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>

      <li>8 ounces ground beef</li>

      <li>4 ounces ground lamb</li>

      <li>1 ¼ teaspoons kosher salt</li>

      <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>

      <li>½ teaspoon ground allspice</li>

      <li>½ teaspoon paprika</li>

      <li>¼ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>

      <li>⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>

      <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons water</li>

      <li>4 bamboo skewers, soaked for at least 1 hour</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Cut toasted bread slice into thin strips on a cutting board; cut strips
        across into a small dice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place onion, parsley, and garlic on top of diced bread on the cutting
        board; chop until mixture resembles tabbouleh.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season beef and lamb with kosher salt, black pepper, allspice, paprika,
        cardamom, nutmeg, and cayenne. Add onion mixture and water. Mix and mash
        with your hands until well combined. Wrap in plastic wrap and
        refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour, up to overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove meat from the refrigerator and roll ¼ of the mixture into a ball
        using wet hands. Pierce in the middle with a bamboo skewer. Shape meat
        into a uniform log, about 6 inches long and 2 inches wide.
      </li>
      <li>Meanwhile, preheat a charcoal grill until coals are very hot.</li>
      <li>
        Place kebabs on the hot grill until browned and cooked through, about 12
        minutes, turning every 3 minutes or so. An instant-read thermometer
        inserted into the center of a kebab should read at least 145 degrees F
        (63 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>Serve and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
